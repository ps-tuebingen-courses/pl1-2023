## Task 1: Compositional interpreter

As suggested by the [lecture notes](https://ps-tuebingen-courses.github.io/pl1-lecture-notes/12-meta-interpretation/meta-interpretation.html),
reimplement the compositional interpreter for FAE as an internal visitor.


## Task 2: Church encodings

In the lecture on [Church encodings](https://ps-tuebingen-courses.github.io/pl1-lecture-notes/13-church-encoding/church-encoding.html),
we have seen Church encodings in FAE of booleans, numerals and operations on them.
This exercise requires you to use them to accomplish some simple programming tasks.

1. We have seen how the exponent operation `exp` is defined in terms of `mult` and `one`. Give a similar definition of
   `mult` in terms of `add` and `zero` (unlike the one presented in the lecture).
2. Study carefully how `multlist` works. Then define a function called `sumlist` that sums all Church-numerals in a list.
3. Bonus: Define a function called `allzeros` that tests whether a list of Church numerals are all zeros.

Do not forget to test your definitions.


## Bonus: Task 3: Object algebras

In the lecture we saw [how to encode expression trees as object algebras](https://ps-tuebingen-courses.github.io/pl1-lecture-notes/14-object-algebras/object-algebras.html).
Give a similar encoding (the interface trait suffices) of binary trees labelled with `Int`s at the leaves.
