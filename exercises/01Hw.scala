/**
Homework 01
============
Before doing anything else, register for the Programmiersprachen 1 exercises
by sending an email to Marius MÃ¼ller:

mari.mueller@uni-tuebingen.de

Write in the e-mail:
- Matrikelnummer
- name
- Studiengang + Abschluss (BSc, MSc, ...)
- Fachsemester
- name of your GitHub account (register under github.com if you do not have one yet)
- your student e-mail address
- optionally: programming languages you already know

You will receive an invitation to our forum for Programmiersprachen 1 (this
may take some time as it is not an automatic respsonse).
In the "Organisatorisches" post you will find everything necessary
to get you started. Read that post first and follow the instructions.

In particular, in that post you will find an invitation to the GitHub Education
platform for Programmiersprachen 1 exercises.

Work in groups of 1 or 2 students.
If you want to work together with another student,
have one of you create a team (you will be asked
to create or join a team by default) and the other
then join that team.

If you have any questions regarding these processes,
just ask in the forum beneath the "Organisatorisches" post.

Submit your solution to this exercise until Monday, 24.04.23, 10:00h
via the GitHub repo for your team and for this exercise.

/**
Consider the following language of propositional logic formulae:
*/
enum Exp:
  case True()  // constant true
  case False() // constant false
  case And(lhs: Exp, rhs: Exp)
  case Or(lhs: Exp, rhs: Exp)
  case Not(e: Exp)
import Exp._

/**
Tasks:
       1) Implement the missing parts of the interpreter for these formulae
          (the eval function).
          Test the correctness by evaluating the example proposition given
          below and add at least two more examples and test against these.

       2) Add implication as a new kind of expression "Impl" and extend
          the interpreter accordingly. Add at least two examples for testing.
