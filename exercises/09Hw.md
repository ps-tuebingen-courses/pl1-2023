## Task 1: Transforming LetCC

Consider the abstract syntax for our language with
[first-class continuations](https://ps-tuebingen-courses.github.io/pl1-lecture-notes/17-first-class-continuations/first-class-continuations.html),
containing the `Letcc` construct:

```scala
case class Letcc(param: Symbol, body: Exp) extends Exp
```

Certain programs using let/cc can be transformed, in a semantics-preserving way
(up to the function wrapper for the outermost continuation `k => ...`, as usual for CPS),
into FAE programs by:

(1) using the CPS transformation and then (2) replacing `Letcc` with a function.

For instance, Racket's `(let/cc k (k 3))`, that is

```scala
val ex: Exp = Letcc("k", Ap("k", 3))
```

transforms to:

```scala
val exCps: Exp = Fun("k", Ap("k", 3))
```

We did not need to do a CPS transformation and directly used a function in place of the `Letcc`.

Now consider a term within which this let/cc term appears:

```scala
Mul(5, Letcc("k", Ap("k", 3)))
```

Here we can eliminate the let/cc by first CPS-transforming the entire term,
taking care of the let/cc later (we indicate this by the square brackets; the
bracketed expression can be thought of as a CPS-transformed version of `Letcc`
expecting the current continuation as an argument to bind it to `"k"`):

```scala
Fun("k0", Ap([Letcc("k", Ap("k", 3))], Fun("a", Ap("k0", Mul(5, "a")))))
```

Note that the body of the let/cc was not CPS-transformed.
We can finish the transformation by directly replacing the let/cc with a function (in the same way we did before):

```scala
Fun("k0", Ap(Fun("k", Ap("k", 3)), Fun("a", Ap("k0", Mul(5, "a")))))
```

Your tasks:

**Subtask 1**: Transform the examples below using the same approach (you can use either Racket syntax or FAE):

1. in Racket: `(+ 1 (let/cc k (k 3))`\
   in FAE: `Add(1, Letcc("k", Ap("k", 3)))`
2. in Racket: `(+ (let/cc k (k 3)) 2)`\
   in FAE: `Add(Letcc("k", Ap("k", 3)), 2)`
3. in Racket:
```
   (+ 3
      (let/cc k
        (let ([f
               (lambda (x) (+ 1 x))])
          (k (+
              (f 2)
              (f 5))))))
```

in FAE:

```
Add(3,
    Letcc("k",
          wth("f",
              Fun("x", Add(1, "x")),
              Ap("k",
                 Add(
                     Ap("f", 2),
                     Ap("f", 5))))))
```

**Subtask 2**: Finally, what about terms like this:

in Racket: `(+ 1 (let/cc k 3))`\
in FAE: `Add(1, Letcc("k", 3))`

Or this:

in Racket: `(+ 1 (let/cc k (+ (k 3) 2)))`\
in FAE: `Add(1, Letcc("k", Add(Ap("k", 3), 2)))`

How are they different from the other examples we saw so far?
Does our transformation approach still work on them? If not, why not?


## Task 2: Delimited continuations

For this task, you need to install DrRacket, which you can download [here](https://download.racket-lang.org/).
There are installers for macOS and Windows available, where you can just follow the instructions.
Once installed, start DrRacket. The window consists of a definition area (editor for Racket) and
an interaction area (a REPL) at the bottom. Paste the following program into the definition area:

```racket
#lang racket
(require racket/control)

(define (one-of l)
  (shift k
         (apply append (map (lambda (x) (k x)) l))))

(define (f l1 l2)
  (reset (list (+ (one-of l1) (one-of l2)))))

(f (list 1 2 3) (list 9 12 154))
```

Then click the "Start" button to evaluate the program.
You will see the following result in the interaction area:

```racket
'(10 13 155 11 14 156 12 15 157)
```

In Racket, this means the same as:

```racket
(list 10 13 155 11 14 156 12 15 157)
```

Note that the program uses delimited continuations in the form of the `shift` and `reset` constructs,
just like the ones we saw in the [lecture](https://ps-tuebingen-courses.github.io/pl1-lecture-notes/19-shift-reset/shift-reset.html).

Your tasks:

1. In your own words, describe what `f` computes. You can start with:
"Given inputs `l1` and `l2`, `f` computes a list containing ...".

2. Which of the following terms could be an intermediate state in the evaluation of `f`.
   (Multiple answers can be correct and there is no order in the answers.)

a)
```racket
(reset
  (apply append
    (cons
      (reset
        (apply append
          (map
            (lambda (x) (reset (list (+ 1 x))))
            (list 9 12 154))))
      (map
        (lambda (x) (reset
                      (list (+ x (one-of (list 9 12 154))))))
        (list 2 3)))))
```

b)
```racket
(reset
  (apply append
    (map
      (lambda (x) (reset
                    (list (+ x (one-of (list 9 12 154))))))
      (list 1 2 3))))
```

c)
```racket
(reset
  (apply append
    (map
      (lambda (x) (list (+ x (one-of (list 9 12 154)))))
      (list 1 2 3))))
```

d)
```racket
(reset
  (apply append
    (cons
      (list 10 13 155)
      (cons
        (reset
          (list (+ 2 (one-of (list 9 12 154)))))
        (map
          (lambda (x) (reset
                        (list (+ x (one-of (list 9 12 154))))))
          (list 3))))))
```

e)
```racket
(reset
  (apply append
    (cons
      (list 157 12 15)
      (cons
        (reset
          (list (+ 2 (one-of (list 9 12 154)))))
        (map
          (lambda (x) (reset
                        (list (+ x (one-of (list 9 12 154))))))
          (list 1))))))
```

f)
```racket
(reset
  (apply append
    (cons
      (reset
        (apply append
          (map
            (lambda (x) (reset (list (+ 2 x))))
            (list 9 12 154))))
      (map
        (lambda (x) (reset
                      (list (+ x (one-of (list 9 12 154))))))
        (list 3)))))
```


Hints:
- Try to find out how the example call of `f` above is evaluated.
  For this, recall what `shift` and `reset` do.
  To get started, you can also try some other example inputs to `f` and compare.
- If you don't know what Racket's `apply` and `append` do you can look it up [here (apply)](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/procedures.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fbase..rkt%29._apply%29%29)
  and [here (append)](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._append%29%29).
