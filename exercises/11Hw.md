## Task 1: Lambda-lifting and defunctionalization

Following examples in the [lecture](https://ps-tuebingen-courses.github.io/pl1-lecture-notes/24-defunctionalization/defunctionalization.html),
apply lambda-lifting and defunctionalization to the following code samples (in increasing order of difficulty).

1.

```scala
def map(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => Int): List[Int] = xs match {
  case Nil     => Nil
  case x :: xs => f(x) :: map(xs)(f)
}

def caller1(l: List[Int]): List[Int] =
  map(l)(x => x + 1) ++
    map(List(1, 2, 3))(x => x + 2)
```

2. (Hint: If there are functions with different types, you can use one separate
    ADT for each type, or you can use a type parameter as done in the lecture.)

```scala
def map(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => Int): List[Int] = xs match {
  case Nil     => Nil
  case x :: xs => f(x) :: map(xs)(f)
}

def flatMap(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => List[Int]): List[Int] = xs match {
  case Nil     => Nil
  case x :: xs => f(x) ++ flatMap(xs)(f)
}

def caller2(l: List[Int]): List[Int] =
  flatMap(List(1, 2, 3))(x =>
    map(List(x + 1))(y =>
      x + y))
```

3. (Hint: Note that there is also a first-class function in `map2`, not just in `caller3`.)

```scala
def flatMap(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => List[Int]): List[Int] = xs match {
  case Nil     => Nil
  case x :: xs => f(x) ++ flatMap(xs)(f)
}

def map2(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => Int): List[Int] = flatMap(xs) {
  x => List(f(x))
}

def caller3(l: List[Int]): List[Int] =
  flatMap(List(1, 2, 3))(x =>
    map2(List(x * 3))(y =>
      x + y + 42))
```


## Task 2: STLC

1. Typecheck by hand the [STLC](https://ps-tuebingen-courses.github.io/pl1-lecture-notes/26-stlc/stlc.html)
   expressions in the following subtasks (in the
   empty context, unless otherwise specified). For each expression, you only
   need to write whether it is type-correct and if so, which is its overall type.
2. Try to predict whether the corresponding Scala versions (copied below) are
   going to typecheck, based on the typechecking behavior of the STLC version.
3. You can check your answers using the actual typecheckers, but you should of course
   only do that after you've done the task by hand.

### Subtask 2.1

This expression is in a non-empty context.

```scala
//Typecheck
val plusOneOpen: Exp = Add("x", 1)
//In the following context:
val plusOneGamma: Map[String, Type] = Map("x" -> NumType())
//The Scala version (pretend that it is in a corresponding context)
//val plusOneScala = x + 1
```

### Subtask 2.2

These expressions are in empty contexts and focus on the core of STLC.

For `e2`, we make use of a type `BoolT`, which can be either added as primitive like `NumType()`
or defined as `SumType(JunitType(), JunitType())`.

```scala
val e1: Exp = Fun("x", NumType(), "x")
//val e1Scala = (x: Int) => x
val e2: Exp = Fun("x", BoolT, "x")
//val e2Scala = (x: Boolean) => x
val e3: Exp = Fun("x", FunType(NumType(), NumType()), "x")
//val e3Scala = (x: (Int => Int)) => x
val funPlusOne: Exp = Fun("x", FunType(NumType(), NumType()), Add("x", 1))
//val funPlusOneScala = (x: (Int => Int)) => x + 1
```
